JumbleFace for the Human Race!

_"JumbleFace for the Human Race" is more than just a catchy phrase with JumbleFace Version 2\. Appreciating diversity is a stated goal of this unique and engaging iOS app._

Duccats has just released version 2 of their creative iOS app, JumbleFace. It's a totally reimagined experience, with many new capabilities and features packed into a free upgrade. Highlights of the changes include:

* New Photos "collection". In addition to the face drawings that have been part of JumbleFace since the beginning, there is now a very unique collection of photo faces that can be manipulated the same way as the drawings. A simple tap on the face part will change it to a very different looking part, but still fitting into the overall face photo. There is also the shuffle button that randomly changes all the parts at once for very unpredictable and interesting results.
* The Classic face collection has been enhanced to provide many more creative options. The potential face compositions for Classic mode is now in the trillions.
* All the graphics have been enhanced to provide beautiful HD images on all iOS devices, iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.
* Fun sound effects have been added to provide a more immersive experience, if desired.
* An optional Symmetry setting now supports faces remaining symmetrical when new parts are selected, and this feature is turned on. So, eyes, ears, etc will match instead of changing independently.
* A new Share button allows easy sharing through your favorite social networks. 

"Purposeful Play" comes especially from the new Photos collection that contains faces from many ethnicities and cultures, and supports the creation of millions of "friends" that represent people from all over the world, encouraging appreciation of our wonderful diversity.
